1.	Using C# IDE, create a class called Circle with an attribute Radius of type double. 
Ensure the Circle class has the following methods:
•	SetRadius method: checks whether the radius is greater than zero. If the radius is greater than zero, it sets it. If the radius is equal to or less than zero, the method throws the exception InvalidRadiusException
•	ToString method: displays all circle object information (radius)
2.	Create a class called InvalidRadiusException class that has the following constructors:
•	A no argument constructor prints a message when the radius is greater than zero.
•	A second constructor accepts the value of the radius and prints it along with a message that it is not valid.
3.	Create a Main class and create the following objects to test your code: 
•	One object with positive radius
•	One object with negative radius
•	One object with radius of zero
